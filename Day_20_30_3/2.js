//In the context of your formatDate function, the padStart(2, '0') method ensures that both the month and the day are always represented by two digits, even if the number is less than 10. This is particularly important for formatting dates, as the standard format is often YYYYMMDD with leading zeros.
//padStart() Method in JavaScript: The padStart() method is a built-in JavaScript string method that pads the current string with a specified character (or string) until it reaches a desired length. This method adds characters to the beginning of the string.

function formatDate(userDate) {
  // Split the input date (M/D/YYYY)
  let formattedDate = userDate.split("/");

  // Return the formatted string in YYYYMMDD format, padding month and day if needed
  return `${formattedDate[2]}${formattedDate[0].padStart(
    2,
    "0"
  )}${formattedDate[1].padStart(2, "0")}`;
}

console.log(formatDate("12/31/2014")); // Output: "20141231"
