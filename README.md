# 30 Days of javascript
Welcome to the 30 Days of JavaScript challenge! This repository contains a collection of JavaScript problems and exercises, organized into daily folders. Each folder corresponds to a day in the challenge, focusing on different concepts, from the basics to more advanced topics.

How It Works
Each day, you'll find a folder named Day 1, Day 2, and so on.
Inside each folder, you will find solutions to JavaScript exercises for that day.
The goal is to work through each day, understanding the concepts and building your JavaScript skills progressively.
